# 42_cursus

My project submissions for the 42 cursus @ 42 Adelaide.

🪐🪐 Ring 0 - 1 project 🪐🪐 ✅

Ring 0 - Libft ✅

    The very first project as a student at 42. The object of the project was to recode 
    functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that 
    will be used during the whole cursus e.g.

🪐🪐 Ring 1 - 3 projects 🪐🪐 ✅

Ring 1 - Born2beroot ✅

    This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization.

Ring 2 - FdF (about 60 hours) ✅

    All programs that you wrote until now were executed in text mode on your terminal. 
    Now, let’s discover something more exciting: how to open a graphics window and draw 
    inside? To start your journey in graphic programming, FdF offers to represent 
    “iron wire” meshing in 3D. 

Ring 2 - minitalk (about 50 hours) ✅

    The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX 
    signals. It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will 
    appear later on in the cursus. 

Ring 2 - push_swap (about 60 hours) ✅

    This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions,
    and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, manipulation of various 
    sorting algorithms and choice of the most appropriate solution(s) for optimised 
    data sorting were required.
