# 42_cursus

My project submissions for the 42 cursus @ 42 Adelaide.

                            🪐 RING 0 - 1 PROJECT --> COMPLETED ✅

Ring 0 - Libft (SOLO, about 70 hours) ✅

    The very first project as a student at 42. The object of the project was to recode functions of 
    the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that will be used during the 
    whole cursus e.g.

                            🪐 Ring 1 - 3 projects --> COMPLETED ✅✅✅

Ring 1 - Born2beroot (SOLO, about 40 hours) ✅

    This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization. 

Ring 1 - ft_printf (SOLO, about 70 hours) ✅

    This project is pretty straightforward, you have to recode printf. You will learn what is and 
    how to implement variadic functions. Once you validate it, you will reuse this function 
    in your future projects. 

Ring 1 - get_next_line (SOLO, about 70 hours) ✅

    May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read 
    content line by line. It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for
    your future projects.

                            🪐 Ring 2 - 3 projects + 1 exam --> COMPLETED ✅✅✅✅

Ring 2 - FdF (SOLO, about 60 hours) ✅

    All programs that you wrote until now were executed in text mode on your terminal. Now, let’s 
    discover something more exciting: how to open a graphics window and draw inside? To start your 
    journey in graphic programming, FdF offers to represent “iron wire” meshing in 3D. 

Ring 2 - minitalk (SOLO, about 50 hours) ✅

    The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. It is
    an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus. 

Ring 2 - push_swap (SOLO, about 60 hours) ✅

    This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the 
    smallest number of moves. To make this happen, manipulation of various sorting algorithms and 
    choice of the most appropriate solution(s) for optimised data sorting were required. 

Ring 2 - Exam Rank 02 ✅

                            🪐 Ring 3 - 2 projects + 1 exam --> IN PROGRESS ✅

Ring 3 - minishell (GROUP, about 210 hours) ✅

    The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell. 

Ring 3 - Philosophers (SOLO, about 70 hours)

    Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. This project is about learning how threads work by precisely 
    timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from 
    hunger.
